## Documentation (writing) sprint
* May 19-June 2

* 10 participants
* 17 PRs created during sprint period

## Things to consider for next time
* possibly shorten audit sprint to 1 week
* plan more lead time for announcing sprints and recruiting volunteers
* book-end sprint with DIG meetings for kickoff and wrap-up (we switched from 2 calendar weeks for the audit to Wednesday + 2 weeks for the wiriting sprint)
* how to assess sprint success
* suggestions from MIG for sprint planning: have clear instructions; break down tasks to small, achievable steps; offer role/tasks for individuals who are not comfortable to perform a full audit or re-writing a page
