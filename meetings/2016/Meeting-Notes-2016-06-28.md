## Attending:

* Chair: Gabriela
* Notes: Robin
* Attending: Don Richards, Janice Banser, Melissa Anez, Robin Dean, Gabriela Mircea


## 1) Approve minutes from last meeting

* [Documentation Interest Group - May 24, 2016 - 3:00 PM Eastern](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-Documentation-Interest-Group/blob/main/meetings/2016/Meeting-Notes-2016-05-24.md )
* Approved, with the change of making it clear that [DIG] is the prefix to use in the emails to the general Islandora list.

## 2) Action items from the last meeting

* Gabriela - send a call for participation out.
  * Sent the call out today, will let DIG know if she hears back.
  * Group discussed offering guidelines on smaller-scale ways to participate, rather than asking for a large, recurring commitment. This would be good to do where we can.
* Robin - turn Peter's guide to solution packs into a wiki page.
  * Made some changes to Peter's guide and posted it to the [Solution Packs landing page](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA/Solution+Packs). Needs review for accuracy and general feedback. Robin will also add some sample types of materials under each solution pack.
* DIG - Work on a guide to help those who volunteer to do documentation during releases.
  * Janice will make a starter Google document with some headings or an outline for this guide.
  * Gabriela will post a call for interest in working on the document together during our next meeting on July 26.

## 3) Islandora 7.x-1.7 release documentation

* Melissa fixed permissions issues for the ISLANDORA717 version of the docs.
* Gabriela and Melissa will work on updating the links in the sidebar for the old versions of the documentation so that the 7.x (Current Release), 7.x-1.7, and 7.x-1.6 versions are all linking to the right copies of the wiki. This needs to be fixed in every version of the existing documentation because of the structure of the current Confluence wiki.    

## 4) Islandora CLAW documentation

* DIG is interested in getting involved in CLAW documentation. 
* There are GitHub issues for documentation tasks, which makes it easier to work on a piece at a time. For example: [https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW/issues/261](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW/issues/261) 
* All CLAW documentation is in markdown and built from the GitHub files into a page at [http://islandora-claw.github.io/CLAW/](http://islandora-claw.github.io/CLAW/). This makes it possible to have issues and pull requests for documentation. 
* DIG supports the use of GitHub for all CLAW documentation, and does not see a need to put any CLAW-related documentation in the Confluence Wiki. GitHub has a lot of advantages for community participation and functionality and appearance of the documentation. 
* Islandora 7.x-1 documentation will continue to be written on the Confluence wiki. 

## 5) Interest Group reports for the Newsletter
* Robin will draft a report and send it to Gabriela by 7/1 for feedback (send to Melissa by 7/4).

## 6) Next Meeting
* July 26, 2016 @ 3 pm EST
* Agenda 
  * Collaborative writing meeting to work on the release documentation guidelines. Robin will chair, Gabriela will take notes.
