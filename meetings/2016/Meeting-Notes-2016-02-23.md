* [Minutes](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-Documentation-Interest-Group/blob/master/meetings/2016/Meeting-Notes-2016-01-19.md)

## 2) Finalize 2016 Meeting Time
* Doodle Poll had a few dates that worked equally well.
* How about 4th Tuesdays at 3 PM Eastern (same time as this meeting)?

## 3) Documentation Versioning

Goal: modify the current practice for wiki documentation versioning to align it with the process for versioning code.

* The /ISLANDORA/START page always contains the most recent version of the documentation. 
* The START documentation will function like the 7.x branch of the code, constantly being updated, including for the purposes of JIRA tickets/bug fixes and releases.
* The release versions of the documentation are treated as snapshots of /ISLANDORA that are made on release day and not updated after the release. (Versions with numbers are not edited after they are created.)

### Proposed new wiki menu structure

* Islandora 7.x (Most Current â€“ the only version that can be modified)
* Islandora 7.x-1.7 (Snapshot of 7.x made on release date and not modified after)
* Islandora 7.x-1.6 (Snapshot of 7.x made on 2016-02-23 and not modified after)

### Proposed new wiki process during releases

1.	On code/documentation release day, a snapshot is made of 7.x (ISLANDORA/START) and renamed with the same version number as the new release. 
2.	Documenters continue to update 7.x until the next release. 

## 4) Islandora 7.x-1.7 Release Team 
* Guidelines for documenters
* More documenters needed?

## 5) Next Meeting
* Chair: Gabriela
* Notes: Robin

## Action items:
* Robin sends out new meeting time to list & Melissa adds it to Islandora calendar
