  * Paying for insider theme gives us access to private repo of Materials theme for MkDocs with add'l features 
  * Danny is investigating way to make insider repo available to Islandora org members, and make it work with Travis
  * "Insider" repo: currently private fork in Islandora organization, tested visibility/permissions
  * Local use requires install with private access token: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/getting-started/
* Old doc page slated for deletion; merged during meeting
