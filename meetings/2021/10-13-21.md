## Notes
- Open pull requests: https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pulls
    - https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/1905 is just about ready. @rosiel will ping folks again. 
    - https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/1897 - also needs a check-in
    - https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/1895 - hard to test because of Travis, requires a bit of trust, but good to go. When do we cut releases going forward, since Islandora itself will not have big, all-encompasing releases any more? We need an evergreen URL, which is one of the features of the sponsored version of Material theme that we are paying for. 
    - https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/1789 - remains troubling. It's useful info, but it is not release notes on its own. Just upgrade instructions. It also needs a menu entry.
- MIG meeting debrief
     - [Glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cfPYFVV9qvvz2VjBRdYUN0CB7AyVDuG-GYavQ27DuBk/edit#heading=h.9fr9xw70meix) was more about Drupal terms, not metadata terms. We can add these to the official gloassary. 
- https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/islandora - was added so Islandora would be listed as a module. Maybe the DIG can take on making sure it gets updated?
