  * (!) ISLE Docs (expected around March, synchronized with Islandora move to Drupal 9)
  * (!) Involve group closer with release cycle 
      * possibly work with Release Candidates - Recommendation to TAG for release timeline to include testing, user testing, code freeze, release candidate to be documented [no testing])
      * Aim for documentation sprint in 2(?) weeks of RC phase
      * work with documentation buddies, as in earlier doc sprints
      * look at recent examples for doc sprints, hackdocs for planning
  * Organize documentation sprint/ on-line hackdoc
  * (!) Work on structure of documentation, prioritize gap-detection or pedagogical approach?
  * Enhance googleability, investigate MkDocs search function (metadata plug-in?)
  * Manage configuration updates through YAML exports, eg. from locked Sanbox: take to other groups, ICC, Tech, User call
  * (!) Audit and flag pages that are old

       * waiting for some fixes
  * DIG 2021 priorities 
       * Co-conveners met to decide on priorities -- flagged with (!) in list of Plans for 2021 above
       * Additional priority not flagged above: hold a sprint or hack-dock for documentation as part of the release process

       * Co-conveners will reach out to MIG on best practices for a sprint
