## Notes

### Open Pull requests 

- https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/1879

There was chatter in Slack about the "manual installation" section about doing some testing. PR  #1879. Seth suggested some changes to original PR committer and we are now waiting on the PR committer for feedback. Issue is related to the version of sub components. Rosie suggested that maybe using a composer file under source control could address the current issue blocking this PR. Mirko wondered if maintaining a sort of list/spreadsheet of install version could help out. We debated as community going to a Docker only approach, but that is not a new debate in the community and there are a few reasons why we cannot just become a Docker only "solution." Mirko is going to try to come up with a possible way to alleviate some of these issues for next meeting. Rosie suggested working with the tech call folks for their thoughts on this too.

This is a PR on how to release. Rosie had made this comment 28 days ago "Discussion from today's call: Can you include instructions on creating the base box, and uploading it where needed?." Rosie suggested that we just accept these release related docs as is, but then add some related issues to cover the information still needing to be documented about the release process. Rosie will put int he new issue.

Yamil just has to recreate this PR under his account since he has a signed CLA.

"An attempt to start documenting release notes."

This is a draft of a release note of Islandora 2.0.0. We took soem time to review what is our current release, and we confirmed 2.0.0 was August 6th. We noticed that https://islandora.ca/download displays version 1.1.0. Melissa will add an agenda item to the tech notes to look over this PR to see if it can be added to the official docs.


### Update on integration of cookbook with documentation

Melissa worked on one item of the cookbook, and she would like to get more help with the cookbook. She mentioned that some images were added in the "lazy Github way," and that we could benefit to ad the images in the assets folder. 


### Review 2-3 documentation issues:

There are currently 44 open doc issues. We are going to check on the last 3. 

- https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/265

Comment from Danny: "Apparently the material theme we're using has this as a paid feature: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-versioning/#versioning" Mirko tested this feature and it worked for him. Had to make a small change in Travis to get it to work. 

- https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/767

Amy wonders if this still relevant, for example is Gemini is being used? Mirko left a comment asking for further clarification. 

- https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/925
Meta-Issue: Migration #925

We wondered if we still need this meta-issue. Should it be updated? Should it be deprecated since new migration content will come from Lyrasis. WE can try linking existing or new migration related issues to this one. 

### MIG working on glossary

DIG will send Mirko and Yamil to attend the next MIG meeting to ask about glossary work.
