* Guidelines on the relationship between Readme files and documentation
* Best practices for creating documentation about new features (cf. [notes from 18 November 2020](../2020/18-11-20.md))
* Go through Material theme "insider" features once we're official supporters
* Plans for 2021 (see [notes from 13 January 2021](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-Documentation-Interest-Group/blob/main/meetings/2021/01-13-21.md)
  * ISLE Docs (expected around March, synchronized with Islandora move to Drupal 9)
  * Involve group closer with release cycle (possibly work with Release Candidates? Recommendation to TAG for release timeline to include testing, user testing, code freeze, release candidate to be documented [no testing])
  * Organize documentation sprint/ on-line hackdoc
  * Work on structure of documentation, prioritize gap-detection or pedagogical approach?
  * Enhance googleability, investigate MkDocs search function (metadata plug-in?)
  * Manage configuration updates through YAML exports, eg. from locked Sanbox: take to other groups, ICC, Tech, User call

## Notes
### New co-convenor for DIG

* David Kwasny (UTSC) joins as co-convenor
* Will join the rotating Chair & Notes

### Updates to documentation

* New add-on that displays the date of the last commit at the bottom of each page is now live
* Style guide updated accordingly
* Manually added dates on several pages have been removed.

### Material theme: pro support 
* Approved by ICC. Danny will take it to the IF Tresurur for sign-off.
* Cary will do some research into the new features we will get

### Open pull requests
* Only https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/1721, still a work in progress/ongoing discussion
    * Still need another pass, but after that, maybe it can just go in. It may not be perfect, but it is better than saying nothing, and it can be refined with use.

### I8 releasing, feedback from TAG
* Release Candidate with feature freeze to allow for documentation?
    * TAG has had some discussions and started [documenting the release process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ueFohEjuXzpOvKW2u5WZnrZzGZtnHT_FKljZ1iUg3XQ/edit)
    * Looking at smaller, mor efrequent releases of components, with a twice-yearly community effort aorund "big" releases with testing and documentation
    * Scheudled releases help with planning maintenance and updates

### Configuration sandbox
* locked sandbox to share/test/document configuration improvements for Islandora defaults
* feedback from other groups?
   * Now on the agenda for next User Call (Feb 18)

### Nigel's Islandora Advanced Search

* [PR exists](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/pull/824) to add this feature to Islandora. Once merged, the DIG should look at taking that readme and turning it into a .md  page to add to our main docs.

## Action items
* [ ] Danny to take Material theme supprot to IF tresuruer for the greelight now that ICC has approved.
* [ ] Danny to make another pass at pull #1721 and get it merged. 
* [ ] Delve into Material theme documentation to check for features that are possibly useful: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ 
* [ ] Danny takes suggestion for release timeline to include RC to TAG
* [ ] Rosie asks for feedback from User Call about YAML configuration update sandbox
