## Notes
* Pull requests: none that can be dealt with in today's group
* Heads-up from Kirsta about plan to distribute issues across repositories in Islandora Github organization; the documentation issue queue would only hold docu issues in the future; DIG has no immediate concerns, plans to move action items to Github issues anyway to focus on one location for collecting to-do's
* DIG role in community sprint
    * Focus areas in the sprint are likely going to be access control, ISLE-DC and 'default' experience/profile 
    * DIG could play a role in the latter
    * Sprint involvement: Melissa available, Mirko probably too
    * Possible sprint task: create documentation issues from spreadsheet
 * Open Meeting November 30th (first week of community sprint): 
    * Suggestion: re-envisioning of documentation structure, "Greenfield approach" to documentation? 
    * Use opportunity to muster input from developers
    * Gap analysis already exists (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E-kRw9xE60CKK0qL1-phzeVKjEZu3qBKZ9d3LH1hDEE/edit#gid=1394671846), issue is often technical/detailed knowledge to actually _write_ the documentation 
    * use outcome of gap analysis in open meeting? 
    * Communicate among co-chairs about Open Mtg Nov 30th, walk-through existing documentation, gaps, contributing
    * Consider answering question "Where to get started?", define baby projects (Arianna); something with quick-to-achieve outcome
* Meta-discussion on documentation
    * Nobody from tech call available in DIG call despite Melissa's pitch in the Tech Call; try using Open meeting as a recruitment opportunity
    * How to get bigger buy-in: DIG often seen as solution to documentation issues, but underresourced
* Issue templates: ties in with plan to distribute issues across repositories, Melissa will add to Tech Call agenda
* Semantic versioning: how could/should documentation follow versioning scheme? Version cycle of Islandora module? When to cut new version? Melissa will add to Tech Call agenda
* Drupal.org contrib module page: important for project's visibility, but reduce to page with link to Islandora documentation for easier maintenance

## Action items
* [ ] Yamil to turn [cookbook template](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/Islandora-Cookbook/blob/main/recipes/recipe_template.md) into Google doc for easier collaboration
* [ ] revisit feature parity document
* [ ] add a reminder to the pull request template for _code_ commits to remember documentation
* [ ] (long term) Removing "8" from docs, as we switch to numberless branding, add reference/explanation about software versioning changes.
* [ ] Co-conveners will come up with text for I8 welcome page based on example https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1787
* [ ] Yamil to make PR for Issue templates
* [ ] Try different approaches for asking contributors to initiate/provide material for documentation
* [ ] Yamil will recreate https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/1816
