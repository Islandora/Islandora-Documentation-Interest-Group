### What do we want to do in 2021?
* ISLE Docs (expected around March, synchronized with Islandora move to Drupal 9)
* Involve group closer with release cycle (possibly work with Release Candidates? Recommendation to TAG for release timeline to include testing, user testing, code freeze, release candidate to be documented [no testing])
* Organize documentation sprint/ on-line hackdoc
* Work on structure of documentation, prioritize gap-detection or pedagogical approach?
* Enhance googleability, investigate MkDocs search function (metadata plug-in?)
* Manage configuration updates through YAML exports, eg. from locked Sanbox: take to other groups, ICC, Tech, User call
