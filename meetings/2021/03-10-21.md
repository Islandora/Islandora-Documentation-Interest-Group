## Future discussion topics (timing TBD)
* Accessibility
* Cooperation with Lyrasis around IMLS grant for Fedora migration
* Guidelines on the relationship between Readme files and documentation
* Best practices for creating documentation about new features (cf. [notes from 18 November 2020](../2020/18-11-20.md))
* Go through Material theme "insider" features once we're official supporters
* Plans for 2021 (see [notes from 13 January 2021](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-Documentation-Interest-Group/blob/main/meetings/2021/01-13-21.md)
  * ISLE Docs (expected around March, synchronized with Islandora move to Drupal 9)
  * Involve group closer with release cycle (possibly work with Release Candidates? Recommendation to TAG for release timeline to include testing, user testing, code freeze, release candidate to be documented [no testing])
  * Organize documentation sprint/ on-line hackdoc
  * Work on structure of documentation, prioritize gap-detection or pedagogical approach?
  * Enhance googleability, investigate MkDocs search function (metadata plug-in?)
  * Manage configuration updates through YAML exports, eg. from locked Sanbox: take to other groups, ICC, Tech, User call

## Notes
### Updates to documentation
* Rosie updated documentation with more conceptual docu, partially moved documentation from other sections of the menu tree
* Rosie plans to further disentangle conceptual and how-to/tutorial style documentation while keeping them interlinked; allowing to describe what something _is_ conceptually in Islandora and/or Drupal, and separately describe how to achieve something (functionality) with Drupal
* Continue discussion in the DIG, using MkDocs configuration YAML file 
* Encouraging support from DIG and others by giving feedback on documentation PRs/issues

### Material theme: pro support 
* Payment didn't go through, Danny will try again
* Awaiting specifics on how pro/'insider' features will be made available to documentation contributors

### Islandora release process documentation
* discussion about process continues
* once finished, release documentation should be part of the Islandora documentation 

### Islandora Defaults
* Born Digital created Drupal install profile and automated process to export configuration settings, possibly available to Islandora Foundation?
* Awaiting specifics

### Advanced Search (sub)module
* Ready to be merged and documented soon
* Rosie motions to add the module as a dependency for a minimal Islandora installation, will be taken up in Tech call

## Action items
* [x] Danny to take Material theme supprot to IF treasurer for the greelight now that ICC has approved.
* [x] Danny to make another pass at pull #1721 and get it merged. 
* [ ] Delve into Material theme documentation to check for features that are possibly useful: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ 
* [x] Danny takes suggestion for release timeline to include RC to TAG
* [x] Rosie asks for feedback from User Call about YAML configuration update sandbox
* [ ] Feedback on PRs from everyone
