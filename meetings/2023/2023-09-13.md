## Agenda
- Community announcements (if any)
- 
- Migration of documentation to different platform (e.g. wiki)
  - Islandora Starter Site Wiki documentation: https://docs.lefaive.ca/wiki/Islandora_Starter_Site
  - Would the switch be tied to a user-a-thon, open metting, or something else?
  - https://docs.lefaive.ca/wiki/Unofficial_Islandora_Wiki
  - Who makes that call?
  - DIG researching pros/cons/effort/cost, put results in front of ..? ICC? LG?
  - Could require considerable labor cost for migration
  - Start by compiling minimal requirements, possible candidates, exit-strategies, workflow for actual content migration
  - Would need sprint to do research, plan
- Did not have time to cover the rest of this agenda below.
- Update from DIG Survey: https://forms.gle/39XY7o1qgpQt3ZUw6
  - Survey is now closed, we need to mine knowledge from the data.
