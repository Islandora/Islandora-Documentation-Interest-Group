    - Was the switch based on the Australian model of records management/arrangement, where provenance and respect des fonds is inverted, essentially: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_continuum_model
  - Possible release model for documentation?
- Migration of documentation to different platform (e.g. wiki)
  - Islandora Starter Site Wiki documentation: https://docs.lefaive.ca/wiki/Islandora_Starter_Site
  - Would the switch be tied to a user-a-thon, open metting, or something else?
  - https://docs.lefaive.ca/wiki/Unofficial_Islandora_Wiki
  - Who makes that call?
  - DIG researching pros/cons/effort/cost, put results in front of ..? ICC? LG?
