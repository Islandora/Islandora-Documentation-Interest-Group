    - hands-on exercise: rewrite sections of documentation using eg. Nielsen Norman UX guidelines
    - Specific examples/tasks for things that could see updates:
      - using existing Python script to create list of pages: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Muw7UbhwrlqXTTObw7BbRhodBAlYkkZ9nsebD4hNSTM/edit#gid=0
      - better integrate YouTube playlist with written documentation, adding/curating backlinks

  - Ideas from last DIG meeting about IslandoraCon work
      - Yamil possibly will have a hands-on demonstration along with presentation.
      - Move back to having documentation releases or scheduled documentation maintenance?
      - May gain new members in DIG because of Islandora Con. DIG should make a list of videos to add to the documentation for new members to help with.
