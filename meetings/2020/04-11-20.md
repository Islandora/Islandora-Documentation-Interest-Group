## Notes
### Check-in
### Review documentation structure proposals
* Group discusses Mirko's proposal: https://github.com/eldonquijote/documentation/blob/mirko-docu-structure/mkdocs.yml
* Group discusses Rosie's proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m3aySaqy3UVNLf4o1ZcLakUbPWoQi5nX1bgERRtMSU0/edit
* Different approaches to structure, based on user roles vs. conceptual/task-based topics
* Possibly combine both approaches, add placeholder pages based on Rosie's list
* Discussion on extent to which Islandora documentation should document Drupal features
  * Documentation should contain/link to core Drupal concepts (Drupal 101?), cases where Islandora contrasts with Drupal concepts need to be highlighted ('Islandora-isms')
  * Possibly use callouts to highlight specialised knowledge/ rabbit holes for advanced configuration options (https://rdmd.readme.io/docs/callouts, https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)
  * How much maintenance burden would it create to duplicate content from Drupal documentation? 
    * Strong advice from Janice to avoid duplication
    * Link targets for Drupal documentation? Drupal.org less comprehensive (less good) than e.g. Drupalize.me, commercial documentation might disappear behind paywall however
* Next steps
  * Melissa suggests to deploy Mirko's suggestions and start addressing gaps and structural changes based on Rosie's suggestion --> Mirko will prepare a pull request
  * Suggestion by Rosie: Add date of last edit to markdown docs --> Melissa will propose changes to styleguide
 
### New edit/change proposal workflow
* Changes can be made without being in the committer user group
* Users will still need a Github account and will need to be made part of the Islandora organization (write to Melissa)

### ISLE Docs
* Rosie is gathering material for ISLE docs in issue https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1676
* HowTo's based on user role/ presumed knowledge of users
* Expand Glossary with technical terms
