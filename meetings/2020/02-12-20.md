* Guidelines on the relationship between Readme files and documentation
* Best practices for creating documentation about new features (cf. [notes from 18 November 2020](18-11-20.md))


## Notes
* New committers added to documentation, new videos added, added information why we make Media in I8, https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/1708
* How-to video on how to create an issue: online
* New documentation themes:
 * Material theme seems significantly more popular than others, highly complete feature-wise
 * Cinder theme looks pretty, but is based on Bootstrap 3 (current is Bootstrap 4)
 * Bootstrap.386 is an option for special occasions like April 1st (https://gitlab.com/lramage/mkdocs-bootstrap386)
* Integrate Rosie's suggested pages into documentation spreadsheet
 * Documenting "the Islandora way" at higher conceptual level? Possibly too early, users need to start understanding how I8 does things compared to I7
 * Reference documentation: useful, what would be relationship between Readme files and documentation? Cf. https://islandora.github.io/documentation/technical-documentation/diagram/ - possible starting point list of features provided by Islandora default
 * Align Islandora defaults features with Functional requirements? ICG currently working on this list, Amy can find out more
 * How to break down documentation of Islandora defaults? https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_defaults - first pass with comprehensive list of what Islandora Defaults does/provides
* Danny working on ISLE readme/technical documentation (https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1712), welcomes comments on issue
* Melissa suggests creating documentation team on GitHub to ping possible reviewers
* CLA for documentation contributions: clarification that documentation contributors need to sign CLA
* Documentation link leads to page which is sub-entry in documentation menu structure, navigating to full menu tree confusing in some views. Consider creating top-level menu entry for "about" landing page. It might be the case that MkDocs doesn't allow a top-level menu entry to be a page at the same time, so menu entries with children might need a landing page for the respective category. 


## Action items
* [] Update footer to include information about making changes to documentation (Cary)
* [] Delve into Material theme documentation to check for features that are possibly useful: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/
* [] Rosie will compile a list of features of what Islandora Defaults provides
* [] Melissa will create a new group of Documentation reviewers on GitHub to tag them on 
* [] Test behavior of menu items which have children, possibly create landing pages
