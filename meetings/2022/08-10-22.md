## Notes

## Action items
* [ ] revisit feature parity document: [Islandora 7.x to Islandora 2 functionality map - feature parity 7 to 8](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jE19AZgwceTo9-eccCRfseiO-4q4iVGPsMWxC5JZrL4/edit#gid=960987100)
* [ ] add a reminder to the pull request template for _code_ commits to remember documentation
* [ ] (long term) Removing "8" from docs, as we switch to numberless branding, add reference/explanation about software versioning changes.
* [ ] Co-conveners will come up with text for I8 welcome page based on example https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1787
* [ ] Try different approaches for asking contributors to initiate/provide material for documentation
