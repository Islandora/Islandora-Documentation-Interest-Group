## Agenda
- As part of the goals outlined for Q2 of the islandora Roadmap, we are looking at setting up a documentation sprint June 20 - June 29, focused on user documentation.
How would DIG like to be a part of the documentation sprint if it goes forward? (Isabella Nikolaidis)
- Consider submitting a proposal for IslandoraCon 2022. More info [here.](https://groups.google.com/g/islandora/c/SzR8BSHBUvo), [submision form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJkgM8AtfZnVwoInBuRuilJ-JbDb9Myyds9D0AXXHN7OLr1w/viewform).
    * workshop? lightning talk? (The deadline for submissions is May 15.) (proposed by Yamil)
    * topics: intro to DIG; intro to Markdown
    * Consider suggestign that the multi-day hackathon includes documentation creation?
- Open pull requests (2-3, max. 20 minutes): https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pulls
- Review Discussions to see there is anything to "discuss" or update basedon current meeting 
- GitHub Discussions - How to draw in more developer contributions
- Review if any unlinked ".md" files need to be linked? https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/2068
- Revisit creating versioned versiosn of docs. For example to address both mentions of "[Resource Node](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/glossary/#repository-item)" (Islandora 8) versus "[Repository Item](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/glossary/#repository-item)" (Islandora 2 + Install Profile?) (proposed by Yamil)
    * Link to relevant Github Discussion on this topic https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/discussions/2089
    * This may be best served by creating an issue then a small PR to add an admonition to explain the differnce in terms. 
- Should we start reviewing docs changes added to docs repo that occur between DIG meetings by looking at [recently closed PRs](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) or [recent commits to main branch](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/commits/main) at every DIG meeting? (proposed by Yamil)


## Notes
* Documentation sprint - June 20 - 29 prelim dates, start with 2 hour Open Meeting, daily check-in. Stand-alone, without dev sprint. Focus on sandbox and user documentation. This uses install profile, which is one way of doing Islandora, but not the only way- is this a consideration? The sandbox is not "How Islandora works," it's "How Islandora could work." Sandbox is a 'gelled version' of Islandora, so it may be a good idea to write around it. Isabella and Yamil will meet to discuss further collaboration, DIG has shared spreadsheet from previous sprints. We need to make it clear in the docs which version/falvor/profile was used.
* Islandoracon - possoble hack-a-thon aspect, maybe a workshop or presentation. A reprise of Mirko's open meeting session. Mirko will draft a workshop proposal for Melissa and Yamil to collaborate.
* Pull requests: https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/2096 - tied to ISLE-DC, needs testing/review. Yamil will review.
* GitHub Discussions: New CLA preocedure, simpler and streamlined. 
* Unlinked .md files? Needs more time and review. Islabella will help review.

## Action items
* [ ] revisit feature parity document
* [ ] add a reminder to the pull request template for _code_ commits to remember documentation
* [ ] (long term) Removing "8" from docs, as we switch to numberless branding, add reference/explanation about software versioning changes.
* [ ] Co-conveners will come up with text for I8 welcome page based on example https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1787
* [ ] Try different approaches for asking contributors to initiate/provide material for documentation
