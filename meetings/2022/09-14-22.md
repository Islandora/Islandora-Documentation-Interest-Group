## Agenda
- Introductions
- Update on 3rd co-convener search
    - Annie joined co-convener check-in and would like to join as co-convener
    - Possible for us to have 4 co-conveners, Michelle's interested but has a time conflict during the time the co-convener check=ins are currently scheduled
- Sprint pre-planning for Q4 doc sprint?
    - What would be the product that is documented?
    - What setup is necessary to test e.g. the Islandora Starter Site
    - Update by Rosie on Islandora modularization project
        - goal is to deprecate Islandora Defaults and provide better out-of-the-box experience with Starter site
        - current deployment method for Islandora Defaults is not following Drupal best practice and possibly confusing to users; deprecating install profile
        - documentation should describe what the Starter Site does and how it does it (modules, configuration), why is this module here/what does it do; should document transitions to new models for accomplishing a feature
        - ideally reorganizing documentation around high-level features (institutional repository functionality, preservation, etc.)
    - Possible sprint (microsprint) could focus on documenting all the modules/dependencies of the Islandora Starter Site
    - Clarifying difference between features/Features (Drupal-specific meaning: ), contexts/Contexts; example for (lowercase f) features: using viewers for content, using OAI-PMH
    - Will stay in touch with Rosie about progress of the project
- Open pull requests (2-3, max. 20 minutes): https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pulls
    - PR#2167: Isabella used Workbench documentation to flesh out Islandora documentation on migration using Workbench, adding video; Rosie offers to add section on adding taxonomies
    - PR#2105: Documenting transcripts, Isabella offers to test
    - PR#2096: ACME binding, still pending review/acceptance of underlying PR
    - PR#2038: Update docker-local.md; Rosie can ping ISLE Slack channel to find someone for review
- Open documentation issues
    - Issue#2154: Rosie, Isabella will look at ways to incorporate this
    - Issue#2153: Adding section to style guide about linking glossary terms
    - Follow-up on CONTRIBUTING: investigate if we need global files (https://github.blog/2012-09-17-contributing-guidelines/)
- Checking previous commits
- Next DIG meeting October, could move co-convener check-in
- (postponed) Review recent documentation repository commits
- (postponed) Review Discussions to see there is anything to "discuss" or update basedon current meeting 
- (postponed) Review feature parity document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jE19AZgwceTo9-eccCRfseiO-4q4iVGPsMWxC5JZrL4/edit#gid=960987100
  - create issue?

## Notes
- inline, see Agenda

## Action items
* [ ] revisit feature parity document: [Islandora 7.x to Islandora 2 functionality map - feature parity 7 to 8](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jE19AZgwceTo9-eccCRfseiO-4q4iVGPsMWxC5JZrL4/edit#gid=960987100)
* [ ] add a reminder to the pull request template for _code_ commits to remember documentation
* [ ] (long term) Removing "8" from docs, as we switch to numberless branding, add reference/explanation about software versioning changes.
* [ ] Co-conveners will come up with text for I8 welcome page based on example https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1787
* [ ] Try different approaches for asking contributors to initiate/provide material for documentation
