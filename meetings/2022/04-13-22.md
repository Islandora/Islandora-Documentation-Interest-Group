## Agenda
- Open pull requests (2-3, max. 20 minutes): https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pulls
- Review Discussions to see there is anything to "discuss" or update basedon current meeting 
- GitHub Discussions - How to draw in more developer contributions
- Consider submitting a proposal for IslandoraCon 2022. More info [here.](https://groups.google.com/g/islandora/c/SzR8BSHBUvo), [submision form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJkgM8AtfZnVwoInBuRuilJ-JbDb9Myyds9D0AXXHN7OLr1w/viewform).
    * workshop? lightning talk? (The deadline for submissions is May 15.) (proposed by Yamil)
- Review if any unlinked ".md" files need to be linked? https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/2068
- Revisit creating versioned versiosn of docs. For example to address both mentions of "[Resource Node](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/glossary/#repository-item)" (Islandora 8) versus "[Repository Item](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/glossary/#repository-item)" (Islandora 2 + Install Profile?) (proposed by Yamil)
- Should we start reviewing docs changes added to docs repo that occur between DIG meetings by looking at [recently closed PRs](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) or [recent commits to main branch](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/commits/main) at every DIG meeting? (proposed by Yamil)

## Notes
* Pulls Requests: 
     * https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/2087 updates links to new name of Commiters group. Rosie will review.
     * https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/2087 - in progress, updating 7 and 8 to just Islandora and 'legacy' as needed.
     * https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/2038 - Moved from draft to a fully-fledged PR. Yamil will review.
* Discussions - Nothing new
* Islandoracon - DIG may collaborate on a lighting talk, see about a live meet-up over lunch
* Resource node, Repository item, etc - what are these terms?
* Versioning docs - As with Islandora 7, we will have to ensure that the "current" version of the docs has an evergreen link that does not change. Only the snapshotted, archived version of the docs would have a unique or tagged url, so that any links can always point to the most recent version, i.e docs/islandora does not change, but docs/islandora.8.1 and docs/islandora.8.2 would be archived versions. 
* Reviewing recently closed commits - prposed new agenda itme to catch undocumented changes or other things that need more attention. 


## Action items

* [ ] Yamil to make PR for Issue templates
* [ ] Yamil to make PR for running spellcheck on offical docs 
* [ ] Try different approaches for asking contributors to initiate/provide material for documentation
