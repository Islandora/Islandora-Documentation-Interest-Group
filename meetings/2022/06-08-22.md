## Notes
* Isabella: Documentation sprint
  * waiting to hear back about VM file for sprint participants; possibly point participants to sandbox.islandora.ca (refresh frequency?)
  * Miro board about documentation structure: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOzHkxxU=/?share_link_id=955643864461, possibly opening to community for collaboration
  * Sprint start date: June 20th
  * Sprint information document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xu-LP0GUo5X5OKvx8ol6HckG8V9DS5T3TwD0qmV_lc/edit#heading=h.lf4qpr5ipgj7
  * Signup, possibly ask participants what they'd need before starting sprint
  * Sprint goal: focus on Sandbox/standard/default experience -- what is standard experience? Documenting what the different experiences are
* Yamil and Isabella will add agenda item to Tech Call, to discuss differences between experiences/installation methods for documentation
  * Mirko's opinion: Sandbox should reflect what users get when they used a documented install method
* IslandoraCon: DIG doc-a-thon workshop, 1 hour
  * volunteer on site? call for volunteers, Isabella will likely facilitate during presentations
  * live stream to on-site participants and Zoom attendees
  * Mirko and Yamil will set up separate call to flesh out workshop agenda
* Pull requests:
  * PR #2112: Reorganizes/cleans pages covering core Islandora concepts, maybe integrate or delete page on resources nodes; Mirko will add to review
  * PR #2105: Rosie documented how to add/use transcripts in Islandora, waiting for review
  * PR #2096: Assigned to Yamil for reviewing, everyone welcome to review as well
  * PR #2038: same as 2096
* Discussions: no new discussions over the last month
* Unlinked .md files: Isabella will revisit, ideally before sprint
* Feature parity document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jE19AZgwceTo9-eccCRfseiO-4q4iVGPsMWxC5JZrL4/edit#gid=960987100 
* Removing references to v.8: mostly done

## Action items
* [ ] revisit feature parity document: [Islandora 7.x to Islandora 2 functionality map - feature parity 7 to 8](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jE19AZgwceTo9-eccCRfseiO-4q4iVGPsMWxC5JZrL4/edit#gid=960987100)
* [ ] add a reminder to the pull request template for _code_ commits to remember documentation
* [ ] (long term) Removing "8" from docs, as we switch to numberless branding, add reference/explanation about software versioning changes.
* [ ] Co-conveners will come up with text for I8 welcome page based on example https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1787
* [ ] Try different approaches for asking contributors to initiate/provide material for documentation
