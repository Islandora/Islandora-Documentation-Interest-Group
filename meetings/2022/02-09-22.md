* https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/isle-dc/issues/220 - waiting for input from Don
* Discussion of GitHub Discussions (https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/discussions)
  * Useful for documentation?
  * Still learning how to use as a tool, whether it suits our needs
  * Difference between discussions and issues? More browsable than Slack
  * Idea is to test discussions as avenue for communication with developers
  * Currently uncertain whether Discussions will take off as tool
  * Yamil hopes Tech Call will add standing item to agenda to check Discussions
  * Melissa will send email reminders about DIG meetings to email list, Yamil will post message to Slack about DIG meetings
  * DIG will continue to observe whether Discussions pick up among Tech Call members
  * Next DIG meeting: Formulate discussion topics, e.g. based on impressions about how Tech Call uses discussion

## Action items
* [x] Yamil to turn [cookbook template](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/Islandora-Cookbook/blob/main/recipes/recipe_template.md) into Google doc for easier collaboration
* [ ] revisit feature parity document
* [ ] add a reminder to the pull request template for _code_ commits to remember documentation
* [ ] (long term) Removing "8" from docs, as we switch to numberless branding, add reference/explanation about software versioning changes.
* [ ] Co-conveners will come up with text for I8 welcome page based on example https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1787
* [ ] Yamil to make PR for Issue templates
* [ ] Try different approaches for asking contributors to initiate/provide material for documentation
